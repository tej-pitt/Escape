# Escape
Text based adventure game comprising multiple files . 
The game is part of the ex45 of LPTHW by Zed Shaw.
The intention was to create different features of the game including rooms ,
room_maps and engine and import them all in one file Main , which will run the game. 

The game is about Ethan Hunt the MI specialist on a rogue mission in an AI unit.
You have to navigate the rooms with decisions and use math skills to solve problems.
At the end it will also test a science question. 
Game requires a little luck alongwith math to win. 

Goodluck and Enjoy!
